work was well organized and compelted in an orderly fashion.

Sprint Retrospective:
Good things we did: 
- Correct work on correct branches
- Testing went smoothly due to merging in required dependencies first
- Improved communication about who is doing what
          
Bad things we did: 
- Put off fixing tests for a while likely due to other assignments and work 
as the semester concludes
          
Improvements for next sprint: 
- Try our best to stay on schedule
