Sprint Review:
The branch orginzation made it much easier to tell what was being added into 
main, but, overall, the sprint was successfull. We would all like to see some 
improvement on communcation so we make sure we are all on the same page about 
who is doing what.

Sprint Retrospective:
Good things we did: 
          New branch naming scheme makes it really easy to tell what is going on
Bad things we did: 
          Proctastinated a little too much coming back from spring break
Improvements for next sprint: 
          Make sure we all know who is doing what
          Avoid merging into main or making a pull request until certain to do so
